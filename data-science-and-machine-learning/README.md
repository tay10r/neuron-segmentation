The sample projects in this folder demonstrate how to perform **Data Science and Machine Learning projects**

We provide **five distinct sample projects**, each designed for quick and easy use to help you get started efficiently.

# 😷 COVID movement patterns with VAR

This project shows a visual data analysis of the effects of COVID-19 and how the population responded to the disease in two different cities: New York and London. It uses fundamental statistical operations for better analysis.

# 🌷 Iris flowers classification with SVM

This Project shows a famous machine learning classification problem using Iris Flower Dataset. The goal of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features. It uses fundamental predictive **machine learning models** such as Logistic Regression for classification.


# 🎥 Recommender Systems with Tensorflow

The Recommender Systems is an AI-powered system designed to provide personalized movie recommendations using **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering**.


# 🚫 Spam Detection with NLP

Spam Detection and NLP shows how computer systems can analyze and interpret texts, more specifically spam, using the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. 

# ✍️ Handwritten digit classification with keras

This Projects shows how to do a simple image classification using **TensorFlow** and MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) database of handwritten digits. The goal is to construct and train an artificial neural network and successfully identify handwritten digits.
