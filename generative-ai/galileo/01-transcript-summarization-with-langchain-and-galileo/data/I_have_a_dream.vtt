00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:03.920
<v 0>I am happy to join with you today</v>


2
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.360
in what will go down in history


3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.460
as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our


4
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.293
nation.


5
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.740
Five score years ago,


6
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.980
a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today,


7
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.540
signed the emancipation proclamation.


8
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.950
This momentous decree came as a great beacon,


9
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.870
light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who


10
00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.630
had been SEAD in the flames of Withing in justice.


11
00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.350
It came as a joyous daybreak


12
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.870
to end the long night of their captivity.


13
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.710
But 100 years later,


14
00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.390
the Negro still is not free.


15
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.910
100 years later,


16
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.250
the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles


17
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.050
of segregation and the chains of discrimination.


18
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.170
100 years later,


19
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.200
the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty


20
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.160
in the midst of a vast ocean of material process. Yes,


21
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.160
this nation will rise up and live out the true


22
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.000
meaning of its.


23
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.843
<v 1>Creed.</v>


24
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.640
<v 0>We hold these choose to be self-evident that all men are created</v>


25
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.603
equal. Yes.


26
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.593
I have a dream


27
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.160
that one day on the red Hills of Georgia,


28
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.040
the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners,


29
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.360
will they be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood?


30
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.720
I have a dream that one day,


31
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
even the state of Mississippi state sweltering with the


32
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.960
heat of injustice


33
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.440
sweltering with the heat of


34
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.160
will be transformed into Oasis of freedom. Injustice.


35
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.313
I have a dream


36
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:56.600
that my four little children


37
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.760
will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of


38
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.640
their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream


39
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.320
that, that one day down


40
00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.560
in Alabama with its vicious racist with its


41
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.660
governor,


42
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.360
having his lips dripping with the words of interposition in nullification, yes,


43
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.560
one day right down in Alabama,


44
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.400
little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little


45
00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.840
white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.


46
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.080
I have a dream that one day, every valley shall be exalted.


47
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.360
And every hill in mounting shall be made low.


48
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.560
The rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made


49
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.220
straight.


50
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.720
And the go of the Lord shall be revealed in all flesh shall see it together.


51
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.520
This is our hope.


52
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.200
This is a faith that I go back to the south with with this faith,


53
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.640
we will be able to hu out of the mountain of despair,


54
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.760
a stone of hope with this faith,


55
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.760
we will be able to transform the dangling discords of our nation into


56
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.080
a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith,


57
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.120
we will be able to work together to pray together, to struggle together,


58
00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.920
to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together,


59
00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.240
knowing that we will be free one day.


60
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.320
This will be the day.


61
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.840
This will be the day with all of God's children. Yes,


62
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.800
will be able to sing with new meaning my country, tears of the yes,


63
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.480
Sweetland of Liberty of the I sing land,


64
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.960
where my fathers died,


65
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.680
land of the Pilgrim pride from every mountain side,


66
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.480
let freedom ring. And if Americas to be a great nation, this must become true.


67
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.240
So let freedom ring from the prestigious hilltops of New Hampshire.


68
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.030
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.


69
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.710
Let freedom ring from the heightening alligators of Pennsylvania.


70
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.910
Noting let freedom ring from the snowcap Rockies of Colorado.


71
00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.790
Let freedom ring from the cous slopes of Colorado.


72
00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.710
Only that let freedom ring from stone. Mountain of Georgia.


73
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.510
That freedom rang from lookout mountain of Tennessee.


74
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:55.070
Let freedom ring from every hill and mall hill of Mississippi


75
00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.560
from every mountain mountainside, let freedom ring. And when this happens,


76
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.440
when we allow freedom ring,


77
00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.840
when we let it ring from every village and every Hamlet from every state


78
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.120
and every city,


79
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.560
we will be able to speed up that day with all of God's black


80
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.800
men and white men, Jews and gen THS,


81
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.600
Protestants and Catholics will be able to join hand and sing in the words


82
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.400
of the old Negro spiritual at last, at last,


83
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.280
thank God we are free at.
